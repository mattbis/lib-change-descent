# lib-change-descent

The first part of how lkman is gonna work...  This probably exists elsewhere much better.

## WIP

- [ ] Typescript? depends whether it mangles the output too much, everything has to remain simple and exact, since GC is the enemy
- [ ] research phase more prior art

- [ ] define tasks and the object shape... 

- [ ] get second and third opinions on the current arch and suggested structure
- [ ] debug and dev/alpha consistency checks
- [ ] core descent logic
- [ ] offset test and playing
- [ ] page sizes (node size)
- [ ] text storage sizes
- [ ] max limits (views, node count, heap size)
- [ ] session
- [ ] consistent error messages with code and standard `[THING]`
- [ ] shared buffer from host and protocol finish... smt is not right here... probably need to get smt working to revise it
- [ ] 3 revision for alpha?
- [ ] performance metrics
- [ ] allow ctors and main as different ways to consume and provide data to the application
