- prefer `var x= true`
- prefer no semicolons - they are totally stupid and due to the transition from B to C... much more is legal than you would think
- 2 spaces is a node JS disease, it makes code too dense, 4 spaces....
- prefer `thing.mjs` instead of `get_` `set_` like Go...
- prefer Python and C style snake case methods ( sorry but its easier to read Node.js has this wrong.. ) this way its easy to see what is built-in and what is a layer ontop... This library is very low-level...
